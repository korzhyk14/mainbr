A standard game of Tic-Tac-Toe in Leo.
## Representing State
Leo allows users to define composite data types with the `struct` keyword. 
The game board is represented by a struct called `Board`, which contains three `Row`s.
An alternative representation would be to use an array, however, these are not yet supported in Leo.

## Language Features
- `struct` declarations
- conditional statements
- early termination. Leo allows users to return from a function early using the `return` keyword.
